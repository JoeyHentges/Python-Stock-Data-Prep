# Python-Stock-Data-Prep
This program takes in a rough data set from the stock market, and prepares it for machine learning. 

The csv file AAPL_data.csv is an example of data the program takes in, and the file done_AAPL_data.csv is an example data/file the program spits out.

The data used in this program was gathered from KAGGLE, but any set of stock data following this format will work.
